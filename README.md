👋 Hi there!

I'm Kusuma, a Computer Science Engineering student passionate about technology and innovation.

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack development** and **data analysis**.

I'm proficient in **Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS**, and frameworks like **Django**.

I'm currently learning Kubernetes, Linux, and exploring cloud technologies.

My goal is to master web development, data analysis, and secure a role in a top-tier tech company.

Outside of Tech,I enjoy 📚 reading biographies, 🎨 painting,  🚀travelling and exploring the latest in science and technology.

Let's connect!!!
